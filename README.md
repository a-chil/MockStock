MOCK STOCK

This a project that I created to assist beginners in the stock market (like myself), by having an option to quickly get quotes for stocks and also "buy" shares of certain stocks upon logging in.

Market data is served by Finnhub, a free API service that provides realtime stock and detailed company data.

This website is hosted on Heroku, with an AWS PostgreSQL RDS instance.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

Good luck!
